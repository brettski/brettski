## Things I've worked with as a Maintenance Programmer

Marty coined this phrase for me years ago, and it made a lot of sense for the the type of works I've done in my life. 
In most of these products I haven't really written applications from scratch, but fixed bugs added functionality, etc. 
It may sound strange, but I really enjoy this type of work. It's interesting to see all the different ways developers have created applications.

- VB
- C#
- Some 4GL program I don't remember the actual name of.
- Cold Fusion
- WinForms, ASP.NET*
- Ubuntu
