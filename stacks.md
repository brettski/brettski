## Things I've worked with as a Maintenance Programmer

Marty coined this phrase for me years ago, and it stuck. It made a lot of sense for the type of work I've done in my life. 
In most of these products, I haven't really written applications from scratch, but I fixed bugs, added functionality, refactored, etc. 
It may sound strange, but I really enjoy this type of work. It's interesting to see all the different ways developers have created applications.
