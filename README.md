_"Little improvements every day"_

## Hi there 👋

- 🔭  I’m currently working on [THAT.us](https://that.us) supporting the geek communities around the globe. Check out our platform; it's [open source](https://github.com/thatconference). 
- 🌱  I'm looking for some idiomatic ways to handle Rust errors as I experiment with the language.
- 🚀  I'm having a lot of fun working with [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). You should try it out! Did I mention it runs on an RPi, too?! 👾
- 👯  I’m looking to collaborate on a course to teach kids programming and electronics using a combination of PICO-8 and Raspberry Pi.
- 💬  Ask me about... whatever
- 📫  How to reach me: I am easily found on X (Twitter); search my name or add an issue [here](https://github.com/brettski/brettski/issues).
- ⚡  Fun fact: Life is better on two wheels 🏍️ - 🚴 - 🛵. I'm always looking for others to cycle with.
- 🤳 I was curious about what stacks I've worked in, so I put a [stack](./stacks.md) list together. Enjoy!

Hey Brett, how did you make this page?✨ Well, I discovered how to do it here: [https://dev.to/natterstefan/how-to-add-a-readme-to-your-github-profile-2bo9](https://dev.to/natterstefan/how-to-add-a-readme-to-your-github-profile-2bo9)  
It has since been document [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) as well.

### Languages I have used over my lifetime in order of most resently used

JavaScript/Nodejs, Lua, Zsh/Bash/sh, Golang, C#, SQL, PowerShell, Groovy, C++, LINQ, VBA, Java, Batch, VB Script, Pascal, BASIC

### Languages learned and never really used

Though, can you really `learn` a language if you really don't use it or write something from scratch in it?

Rust, Erlang, Ruby, Python   
_I sure do want to build out some stuff in Rust though!_
