### Languages I have used over my lifetime in order of most resently used

JavaScript/Nodejs, Lua, Zsh/Bash/sh, Golang, C#, SQL, PowerShell, Groovy, C++, LINQ, VBA, Java, Batch, VB Script, Pascal, BASIC

### Languages learned and never really used

Though, can you really `learn` a language if you really don't use it or write something from scratch in it?

Rust, Erlang, Ruby, Python   
_I sure do want to build out some stuff in Rust though!_
